1. Create following tables and solve thequeries.
   room(roomid,rname,rloc)

   CREATE TABLE room(
   rid int primary key,
   rname varchar(15) not null,
   rloc varchar(20));



Room
roomid rname rloc
100 jasmin 1st floor
101 Rose 2nd floor
105 Lotus 1st floor
103 Mogra 1st floor


INSERT room values(100,'Jasmin','1st floor');
INSERT room values(101,'Rose','2nd floor');
INSERT room values(105,'Lotus','1st floor');
INSERT room values(103,'Mogra','1st floor');
--------------------------------------------------------
   faculty
   fid fname   spskill1   spskill2
   10   Amol   database   JAVA
   11   Asha   JAVA       MySQL
   12   Kiran  CPP        Database
   13   Seeta  MySQL      database

create table faculty1
(
 fid int,
fname varchar(15),
spskill1 varchar(10),
spskill2 varchar(10)
);

insert into faculty1 values(10,'Amol','database','JAVA');
insert into faculty1 values(11,'Asha','JAVA','MySQL');
insert into faculty1 values(12,'Kiran','CPP','DAtabase');
insert into faculty1 values(13,'Seeta','MySQL','database');

----------------------------------------------------
   courses
   cid cname rid fid
   121 DBDA 100 10
   131 DAC 101
   141 DTISS
   151 DIOT 105 12

create table courses
(
cid int,
cname varchar(15),
rid int,
fid int
);

 alter table courses add foreign key(rid) references room(rid);

    INSERT courses values(121,'DBDA',100, 10);
    INSERT courses (cid, cname, rid) values(131,'DAC',101);
    INSERT courses (cid, cname) values(141,'DTISS');
    INSERT courses values(151,'DIOT',105, 12);



1. list all courses for which no room is assigned and all rooms which are available\
select cname 
  from course c

  where not exists (select * 
                    from room r 
                    where c.rid = r.rid )

  union

  select rname 
  from room p 

  where not exists (select * 
                    from course k 
                    where k.rid = p.rid );


 
2. list all faculties who are not allocated to any course and rooms which are not allocated to any course
 

select fid,fname,rname,rid
  from faculty f 
  left join course c 
  on f.cid=c.cid 
  union
  select fid,fname,rname,rid
  from faculty f 
  right join course c 
  on f.cid=c.cid 


3. list all rooms which are allocated or not allocated to any courses

select rid,rname,cid,cname
  from room r
  left join course c on r.cid=c.cid;

4. list all rooms which are not allocated to any courses

select rid,rname
  from room
  where not exists (select *
   from course
  where c.rid=r.rid);


5. display courses and faculty assigned to those courses whose special skill is database

select *
form courses c
inner join faculty f 
on c.fid=f.fid
where spskill1='database' or spskill2='database';


6. display time table --- it should contain course details , faculty and room details

select cid,cname ,rid,rname,fid,fname
from room r 
inner join course c 
on c.rid=r.rid 
inner join faculty f 
on c.fid=f.fid;
